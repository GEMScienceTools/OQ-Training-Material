\section{Model description}

The model used for this demo corresponds to the model proposed by 
\citet{midzi1999} in the context of the GSHAP project.

This seismic source model contains 21 area sources distributed within a wide 
band that goes from the Red Sea until South Africa.

\section{Assignment: hazard calculation using the demo model}
The first assignment focuses on the calculation of hazard for a small area 
using Openquake and demo model provided.
